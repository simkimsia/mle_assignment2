# Discrepancy Report: task1_plan.md vs TESTING_AIRFLOW.md

## Summary

This report compares the implementation plan with the actual current state and identifies what has been updated.

---

## üìã **Changes Made**

### 1. Updated `task1_plan.md`

**Added New Section:** "DAG DummyOperator Strategy" (Lines 3-71)

**Content:**
- ‚úÖ **DummyOperators to KEEP** - Explains the 10 workflow marker operators and why they should remain
  - Workflow visualization
  - Dependency management
  - Industry best practice

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DummyOperators to REPLACE** - Lists 6 operators that need implementation
  - 2 AutoML operators (model training)
  - 2 Inference operators (predictions)
  - 2 Monitor operators (performance tracking)

**Purpose:** Clarifies which DummyOperators are intentional design choices vs. incomplete implementations.

---

### 2. Updated `TESTING_AIRFLOW.md`

**Section "State" completely rewritten** (Lines 182-272)

**Old State (OUTDATED - Now Fixed):**
```
‚è∏Ô∏è Where You Are Now at 2025-10-24 Friday:
"You're at the transition between Section 1 and Section 2"
Need to create: silver_label_store.py, gold_label_store.py,
bronze_table_1/2/3.py, silver_table_1/2.py, gold_feature_store.py
```

**New State (CURRENT - Accurate as of 2025-10-25):**
```
‚úÖ Current Status as of 2025-10-25 Saturday:
COMPLETED - Sections 1 & 2
All 9 data pipeline scripts created and working
Pipeline tested successfully in Airflow
```

---

## üîç **Discrepancies Identified**

### ‚ùå **DISCREPANCY #1: Implementation Progress (RESOLVED)**

**What was wrong:**
- `TESTING_AIRFLOW.md` stated the data pipeline scripts were NOT yet created
- This was **outdated** information

**What's correct:**
- All 9 data pipeline scripts ARE created and working:
  1. ‚úÖ `bronze_label_store.py`
  2. ‚úÖ `silver_label_store.py`
  3. ‚úÖ `gold_label_store.py`
  4. ‚úÖ `bronze_table_1.py`
  5. ‚úÖ `bronze_table_2.py`
  6. ‚úÖ `bronze_table_3.py`
  7. ‚úÖ `silver_table_1.py`
  8. ‚úÖ `silver_table_2.py`
  9. ‚úÖ `gold_feature_store.py`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in updated `TESTING_AIRFLOW.md`

---

### ‚ùå **DISCREPANCY #2: DAG DummyOperators Status (RESOLVED)**

**What was wrong:**
- `TESTING_AIRFLOW.md` mentioned DummyOperators but didn't explain which ones were intentional
- Could cause confusion about what still needs to be done

**What's correct:**
- 10 DummyOperators are **intentional workflow markers** (keep as-is)
- 6 DummyOperators are **incomplete tasks** (need to be replaced)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - `task1_plan.md` now has dedicated section explaining this

---

### ‚ùå **DISCREPANCY #3: Next Steps Clarity (RESOLVED)**

**What was wrong:**
- `TESTING_AIRFLOW.md` listed next steps that were actually already completed

**What's correct:**
- Sections 1-2 are 100% complete
- Next steps are Sections 3-9 (ML implementation)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Updated immediate next steps to reflect ML implementation priorities

---

## ‚úÖ **Current Alignment Status**

Both documents now accurately reflect:

1. **What's Complete:**
   - Section 1: Data Foundations ‚úÖ
   - Section 2: Airflow Orchestration ‚úÖ
   - 9 data pipeline scripts ‚úÖ
   - All bronze/silver/gold ETL working ‚úÖ

2. **What's Not Started:**
   - Section 3: Model Training (need 2 scripts)
   - Section 5: Inference (need 2 scripts)
   - Section 6: Monitoring (need 2 scripts)
   - Section 7: Visualization
   - Section 8: SOP Documentation
   - Section 9: Final Delivery

3. **DummyOperator Clarity:**
   - 10 markers to keep (documented)
   - 6 tasks to replace (documented with specs)

---

## üìä **Progress Tracking**

| Section | Status | Scripts | DAG Status |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| 1. Data Foundations | ‚úÖ Complete | 3 scripts | BashOperators |
| 2. Airflow Setup | ‚úÖ Complete | 6 scripts | BashOperators |
| 3. Model Training | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/2 scripts | DummyOperators |
| 4. Model Store | ‚ùå Not Started | Integrated in #3 | N/A |
| 5. Inference | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/2 scripts | DummyOperators |
| 6. Monitoring | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/2 scripts | DummyOperators |
| 7. Visualization | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/1 script | N/A |
| 8. SOP Docs | ‚ùå Not Started | 0/1 doc | N/A |
| 9. Validation | ‚ùå Not Started | N/A | N/A |

**Overall Progress:** 22% (2 of 9 sections complete)

---

## üéØ **Recommendation**

Both documents are now **synchronized and accurate**.

**Next action:** Proceed with implementing the 6 ML scripts (Sections 3, 5, 6) as outlined in the updated `TESTING_AIRFLOW.md` immediate next steps.
