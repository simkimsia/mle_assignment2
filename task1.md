# Task 1

You are to build an end-to-end ML pipeline that performs the following:

- Train ML models, evaluates and selects the best model to be stored in a model store (could be just a folder of artefacts for this assignment)
- Retrieves best models to make predictions / inference across a time period and stores the model predictions as a gold table in the datamart
- Monitor the performance and stability of the model predictions across a time period, stores the monitoring results as a gold table in the datamart
- Visualise the performance and stability of the model across a time period
- Decide on model governance and SOP on when / how to refresh the ML model in production, and deployment options.
